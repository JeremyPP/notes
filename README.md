# Encrypted Notes

A web application that stores encrypted notes.

Notes are encrypted in-browser and the password is never sent to the server -- so you can store secrets online without the requirement to trust your service provider.

Find notes with Sublime Text like *fuzzy* search...

You can also have a look at a notebook populate with notes here:
