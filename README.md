# Encrypted Notes

A web application that stores encrypted notes.

Notes are encrypted in-browser and the password is never sent to the server -- so you can store secrets online without the requirement to trust your service provider.

Find notes with Sublime Text like *fuzzy* search...

See the following for a demonstration:

passphrase `where there is a will`

Feel free to edit that, or create your own notebook:
